     Skip "Testing trap setup directly is complex and environment-dependent"
     # Verifying traps requires inspecting the shell's internal state ('trap -p')
     # or triggering trapped signals/errors, which is hard to isolate in tests.
     It "sets up ERR and EXIT traps (conceptual test)"
       # Conceptually, after calling setup_traps, specific trap handlers should be set.
       # We can check if the function runs without error.
       When call setup_traps
       The status should be success
